apkg THANKS file
 
apkg was originally written by Andrei Oprisan.  It would
not be what it is today without the invaluable help of 
Stanislav Brabec and Michal Vyskocil, who have reported problems, 
suggested improvements, or submitted actual code. 
Also, without the Google Summer of Code program, this project most
likely would not have been developed and grown, and we hope
that it will continue to grow and expand.

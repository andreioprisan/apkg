Version 0.8
 1. minidom XML writer for writeback to initial configuration file
 
** GSOC DEADLINE **
** FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS ARE PAST GSOC

Version 0.7
 1. crossplatform GUI xml editor (incomplete)

Version 0.6
 1. export build data as RPM build spec file
 2. export build data as raw data file
 3. export build data as shell script
 3. todo: finish up XML writer so that build data can be submitted as XMLs

Version 0.5
 1. parser extracts commands/variables for heuristics from config
 2. heuristics: automake: build steps
 3. heuristics: automake: ask whether or not to run each command
 3. heuristics: automake: package archive completion from complete build 

Version 0.4
 1. heuristics: automake: step-by-step prompting for features, packages, and tuning variables
 2. heuristics: automake: easier to extend and very clear how it works
 3. heuristics: automake: todo: make more functions to clean up code

Version 0.3
 1. improved ftp/http clients with the new parser
 2. heuristic prompting for file downloads
 3. downloading patches works correcly
 
Version 0.2
 1. (new) and much more efficient and extensible XML parser
 2. modified config layout should be clearer now
 3. adding/modifying tags in the parser now only requires only delaring the global schema for the array and adding the necessary tag/parameter name boolean variables
 4. both parameters and tags work correctly

Version 0.1.2
 1. distribution specific XML tagging

Version 0.1.1
 1. parser: new parser replaces old parser (too slow and buggy, plus it became almost impossible to maintain - very bad sign - rewrite needed)
 		    should be more extensible to rewrite XMLs (TODO: actually make it work, it hangs due to errors now)
 		    
Version 0.1
 1. WEBPKGDB: interface to build XML control files
 2. WEBPKGDB: package database scheme set up
 3. WEBPKGDB: authentication to upload control files through database and build results
 4. WEBPKGDB: query interface to commandline query access
 5. TODO (Uncommitted DTB: 4 - MAIN): query interface to db for control files
 6. TODO (Uncommitted DTB: 4 - MAIN): more command line argument parsing options
 7. HEURISTICS: on-the-fly command output supported (delayed after completion also available in comments)
 8. TODO (Uncommitted DTB: 7): implement option for delayed after completion command output
 9. HEURISTICS: AUTOMAKE: improvements and code cleanup
 12. ARCHIVE: archiving and unarchiving parser
 13. LOG: all output goes through the logger (easier to separate output/debug information later and ensure program continuation)
 14. ALL: all prints replaces in favor of python logger scheme logger
 15. APKG: shell wrapper to call source/__init__.py with python
 16. WEB: over 20 packages are available 

Version 0.0.4
 1. MAIN: command line argument parser
 2. MAIN: heuristics support
 3. HEURISTICS: automake, perl, and python
 4. HEURISTICS: dynamic heuristics set up the right way (finally!) through heuristics/__init__.py controller
 5. HEURISTICS: AUTOMAKE: support 

Version 0.0.3
 1. MAIN: split XML And FTP in proper modules and using object attributes as needed
 2. XML: OOP classes now used
 3. XML: parsed for build environment options 
 4. (TODO 2) XML: parse for full build commands   
 5. FTP: OOP classes now used
 6. FTP: can get patches as well as archives 

Version 0.0.2
 1. MAIN: environment setup and cleanup based on apkg's pid
 2. XML:	also provides resources to be downloaded
 3. XML: resource hashes added for verification purposes
 4. FTP: resources placed in the process's work folder
 5. FTP: progress bar with md5 hash verification and disk write verification (binary only)
 6. MD5: md5 function that reads file into smaller buffers, as opposed to one big file 
 7. (TODO 1) FTP: provide the same for patches and other ascii files, not just binary
 
Version 0.0.1
 1. Initial Code Commit
 2. XML: parser and sample package manifest files created
 3. XML: proper element, attribute, and content listing
 4. MAIN: resource usage analysis for each stage

| apkg |=> an abstract package tree creation tool
\======/

Born as part of a Google Summer of Code 2008 project, apkg is a dynamic source analysis and distribution tool.
apkg includes an extensible XML parser and heuristic model for source tree self-analysis. 
Successful build results can be exported to RPM spec files, shell scripts, or raw data. 

The 1.0 release will also include full XML back-export (export results to original configuration file),
as well as cross-platform GUI XML configuration file editing.

will use this tool at your own risk.
